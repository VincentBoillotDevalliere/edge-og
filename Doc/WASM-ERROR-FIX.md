# WASM Error Fix - CompileError Resolution

## Problem
The Edge-OG worker was failing in local development with the following error:
```
CompileError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): Wasm code generation disallowed by embedder
```

This error occurred because WebAssembly compilation is often restricted in local development environments, preventing the `@resvg/resvg-wasm` library from initializing properly for PNG conversion.

## Solution
Implemented a robust fallback mechanism with enhanced error detection and graceful degradation:

### 1. Enhanced WASM Error Detection (`src/render/png.ts`)
- Added specific detection for `CompileError` and "Wasm code generation disallowed" errors
- Improved error messages to guide developers on using `format=svg` for testing
- Maintained existing WASM initialization flow for production environments

### 2. Improved Fallback Logic (`src/render/index.ts`)
- Enhanced fallback detection to catch WASM-related errors specifically
- Added automatic SVG fallback when PNG conversion fails due to WASM issues
- Maintained performance requirements with graceful degradation

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling (`src/index.ts`)
- Added top-level error catching for WASM compilation errors
- Automatic retry with SVG format when WASM errors are detected
- Proper error logging and monitoring integration

## Technical Implementation

### Error Detection Pattern
```typescript
const isWasmError = error instanceof Error && (
  error.message.includes('WASM') ||
  error.message.includes('WebAssembly') ||
  error.message.includes('CompileError') ||
  error.message.includes('code generation disallowed') ||
  error.message.includes('PNG conversion is not available in local development')
);
```

### Fallback Behavior
1. **PNG Request in Local Development**: 
   - Attempts PNG conversion via WASM
   - If WASM fails, automatically falls back to SVG
   - Returns SVG with proper `image/svg+xml` content type
   - Logs `fallback_occurred: true` for monitoring

2. **SVG Request**: 
   - Always works without WASM dependencies
   - Direct SVG generation using Satori

3. **Production Environment**:
   - WASM should work normally in Cloudflare Workers
   - PNG conversion proceeds as expected
   - No fallback necessary

## Verification
- ✅ Local development now returns SVG when PNG fails
- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass
- ✅ Proper error logging and monitoring
- ✅ Performance requirements maintained
- ✅ Production functionality unaffected

## Usage Guidelines

### For Local Development
```bash
# These will now return SVG automatically when WASM fails
curl "http://localhost:8787/og?title=Test&description=Hello"
curl "http://localhost:8787/og?title=Test&format=png"

# Explicit SVG requests always work
curl "http://localhost:8787/og?title=Test&format=svg"
```

### For Production
```bash
# PNG conversion should work normally in Cloudflare Workers
curl "https://your-domain.com/og?title=Test&format=png"
```

## Log Output
When the fallback occurs, you'll see:
```json
{
  "event": "image_rendered",
  "actual_format": "svg",
  "fallback_occurred": true,
  "request_id": "...",
  "duration_ms": 375
}
```

## Files Modified
- `src/render/png.ts` - Enhanced WASM error detection
- `src/render/index.ts` - Improved fallback logic
- `src/index.ts` - Top-level error handling

This fix ensures that Edge-OG works seamlessly in both local development (with SVG fallback) and production environments (with full PNG support), maintaining the developer experience while providing proper error handling and monitoring.
